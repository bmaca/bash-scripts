## Password generator written in Python 
----------

### Dependencies 
 * Python (Run ```which python```) to see if python is installed. 

The script by default will generate a 20 character password. If you would like to make it shorter or even longer, just change the ```length``` variable. 


### How to run the script
* Copy the script into your desired dirctory
* ```cd``` into that directory 
* Run ``` python genpasw.py ```

Thats All!

### To DO:

* I should probably make the length requirment a CLI argument.
